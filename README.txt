This is a homework project from my university.

What I did in the first part (A3.py) is that I read a input height for the cruise level of an airplane and I plot the flight trajectory based on hight and horizontal progress of the route (KM). Another graphic shows the estimated fuel consumption based on the takeoff climbing angle and landing descending angle. Then, you are able to input from the keyboard a time of the flight and see the position of the aircraft at that specified time.

The bonus part (BonusAufgabe.py) gets the flight level of three aircrafts and plots them into the same graph, where it (height/horizontal progress). Then, you will see a live-updating graph that simulates the aircrafts following their flight routes.

All plots are 2D !
